We will be running our scheduled monthly tape backups on Sunday, May 4, beginning in the afternoon. During this process, all user data will be securely archived to tape storage for disaster recovery and compliance purposes.

No computers will be rebooted or taken offline, and running processes will not be terminated. However, you may notice slightly slower input/output performance while the backups are in progress, especially for large file transfers. We recommend saving your work frequently and avoiding large data migrations during the backup window. If you have questions about the backup process or need to restore files, please contact the support team.
