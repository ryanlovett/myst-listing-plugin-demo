## Investigating 2025-02-20 10:13a

The login-node-01 server began exhibiting severe hardware instability, locking up repeatedly and causing user sessions to terminate unexpectedly. The system was taken offline for diagnostics, and memory tests were initiated to identify the faulty component.

## Resolved  2025-02-21 4:06p

After extensive memory stress testing, login-node-01 was brought back online. No further errors were detected, but we continued to monitor the system closely for recurring issues.

## Investigating 2025-04-03 10:06a

A new round of RAM errors was detected on login-node-01, likely due to a failing memory module. Users were advised to use alternative login nodes while we replaced the affected hardware.

## Monitoring  2025-04-03 2:06p

The problematic memory module was removed, and login-node-01 was returned to service. We are monitoring for any further hardware anomalies and encourage users to report any instability.
