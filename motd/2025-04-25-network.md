We will be performing maintenance on the network interfaces of our file server today at 2pm to increase bandwidth and improve performance for all users. The expected downtime is less than one minute, but there is a slight chance a reboot may be required. All running jobs should remain unaffected, and we will monitor the system closely to ensure a smooth transition. Please contact support if you notice any lingering issues after the maintenance window.
