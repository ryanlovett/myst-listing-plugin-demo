## Investigating 2025-04-12

The head node of our remote cluster became inaccessible, preventing users from submitting jobs or accessing data. We immediately contacted the data center team to investigate possible causes, including network failures and hardware issues.

## Resolved 2025-04-16 11:00a

The data center staff identified a malfunctioning network interface on the head node. After repairs, connectivity was restored and all cluster services resumed normal operation. We are monitoring the system for further issues and thank users for their patience during the outage.
