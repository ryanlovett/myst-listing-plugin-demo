## Investigating 2025-02-06 11:30p

Late in the evening, several wired networks in our building suddenly went offline. This disrupted access to shared drives, printing, and internet connectivity for both staff and students. The issue was reported to campus IT, who began diagnostics on the affected switches and routers.

Network connectivity was gradually restored shortly after midnight. The root cause was traced to a failed core switch, which was replaced by the IT team. We are monitoring the network for any further instability and will provide updates if needed.
