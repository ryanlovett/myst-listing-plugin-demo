## Investigating 2025-01-04 9:27a

Early this morning, a significant power outage affected the north side of campus, including our primary server rooms. All systems went offline unexpectedly, impacting research computing, email, and file storage. Facilities and IT teams were immediately notified and began assessing the situation.

## Monitoring 2025-01-04 11:06a

Power remained out for several hours. Emergency lighting was operational, but card readers and network access were unavailable, restricting physical and remote access to critical infrastructure. We coordinated with campus security to ensure the safety of equipment and data.

## Resolved 2025-01-04 4:00p

Campus issued WarnMe notifications confirming power restoration in the afternoon. Most servers were brought back online by 4pm, but a few required manual intervention due to hardware checks and system integrity verifications. Full service was restored by the following Monday after thorough inspections.
