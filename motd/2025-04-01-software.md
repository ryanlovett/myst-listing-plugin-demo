With the recent operating system upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04, we have also upgraded to Python 3.13 and R 4.4.3. These new versions bring enhanced performance, security updates, and improved compatibility with modern libraries. Older versions remain available via the module system for legacy workflows. Please review your scripts for compatibility and let us know if you encounter any issues.
