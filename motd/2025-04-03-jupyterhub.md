The default Python kernel in JupyterHub has been upgraded from 3.12 to 3.13 to align with our recently updated login environment. The previous kernel remains available as "Python 3.12" in the JupyterLab launcher for compatibility with older projects.

Additionally, the remote desktop feature has been improved. The latest version now supports copy/paste, dynamic desktop resizing, a direct link back to the hub, and enhanced security through the use of a Unix socket. These changes aim to provide a smoother and more secure user experience.
