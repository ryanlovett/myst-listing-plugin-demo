We arrived at Bree under the cover of darkness, weary from the road. The Prancing Pony offered a brief respite, though the air was thick with unease. It was here that we met Strider, a mysterious ranger who seems to know more about our quest than he lets on.

Though I was hesitant to trust him at first, his knowledge of the wilds and his promise to guide us to Rivendell have given me hope. The journey grows more perilous with each passing day, but I am grateful for the allies we find along the way.
