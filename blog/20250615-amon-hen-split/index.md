Amon Hen will forever be etched in my memory as the place where the fellowship was broken. The decision to continue alone was not an easy one, but the Ring's influence is too dangerous to ignore. I cannot risk the lives of my friends any longer.

Sam, ever loyal, refused to let me go alone. Together, we set out on the next leg of this perilous journey. Though the path ahead is uncertain, I am comforted by his unwavering support. The burden of the Ring is heavy, but I am not alone.
