![Last sight of Hobbiton](lastsight.jpg 'Last Sight')

Today marks the beginning of my journey from the Shire. With Sam by my side, we set out early in the morning, leaving behind the comfort of Bag End. The road ahead is uncertain, but the weight of the One Ring reminds me of the importance of this quest.

As we passed through the familiar fields and woods, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. Yet, there is also a sense of excitement for the unknown adventures that await. The first step is always the hardest, but it is also the most crucial.
