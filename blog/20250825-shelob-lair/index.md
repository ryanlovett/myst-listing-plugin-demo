Shelob's Lair is a place of nightmares. The darkness is suffocating, and the air is thick with the stench of decay. Gollum's betrayal has led us into this deadly trap, and the monstrous spider is unlike anything I have ever faced.

Though fear grips my heart, I find strength in the thought of what is at stake. Sam's bravery in the face of such danger is a beacon of hope. Together, we must find a way to escape this dreadful place and continue our journey to Mount Doom.
