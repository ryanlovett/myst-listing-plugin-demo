The Anduin River carries us further from the safety of Lothl√≥rien and closer to the heart of danger. The current is strong, and the journey by boat is both a relief and a challenge. The Ring's pull grows stronger with each passing day.

As we navigate the river, I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder. The enemy is never far behind, and the weight of our mission is ever-present. Yet, the fellowship remains steadfast, and their courage gives me strength to carry on.
