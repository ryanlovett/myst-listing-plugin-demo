After the trials of Moria, Lothlórien feels like a sanctuary. The beauty of this elven realm is beyond words, and the kindness of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn has renewed our spirits. For a brief moment, the burden of the Ring feels lighter.

As we rest and gather our strength, I can't help but reflect on the road ahead. The gifts bestowed upon us by the Lady will surely aid us, but the path to Mordor remains fraught with peril. Still, I am grateful for this moment of peace amidst the chaos.
