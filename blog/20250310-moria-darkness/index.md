The mines of Moria are as dark and foreboding as the tales say. Each step echoes through the vast, empty halls, a reminder of the dwarves who once thrived here. Danger lurks in every shadow, and the weight of the Ring feels heavier than ever.

Gandalf's guidance is our only light in this oppressive darkness. Despite the fear that grips us, we press on, knowing that turning back is not an option. The journey through Moria is a test of our resolve, and I can only hope we emerge unscathed.
