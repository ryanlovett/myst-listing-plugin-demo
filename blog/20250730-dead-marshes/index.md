The Dead Marshes are a haunting place, filled with the echoes of battles long past. The air is thick with decay, and the ghostly lights in the water are a constant reminder of the lives lost here. Gollum, our reluctant guide, leads us through this treacherous terrain.

Each step feels like a struggle, but Sam's determination keeps me moving forward. The Ring's pull is stronger than ever, and I can feel its influence growing. Yet, I know we must press on, for the fate of Middle-earth depends on it.
